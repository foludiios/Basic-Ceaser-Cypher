# Description
## A beginner attempt at the basic Ceaser Cypher encryption.

This encrypts only letters of the alphabet by offputting them by a "key" value, specified by the user in the function.
It also provides a decryption function to enable decryption of any message when provided the encryption key and the encrypted message.

Great practical use? Most definitely not. Great for understanding the Ceaser Cypher and testing the python logic? Absolutely!!
